    "**What is the Altman Z-Score?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Altman Z-Score is a formula developed in 1968 by Edward Altman to predict the likelihood that a company will go bankrupt within two years. It analyzes several financial ratios to determine the overall financial health of a company.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- It was developed in 1968 by Edward Altman and combines five financial ratios using a weighting system to calculate the overall Z-Score.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **X1 Working Capital / Total Assets:** X1 is the ratio of Working Capital divided by Total Assets. It measures a company's liquidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **X2 Retained Earnings / Total Assets:** X2 is the ratio of Retained Earnings divided by Total Assets. It measures profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **X3 EBIT / Total Assets:** X3 is the ratio of Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) divided by Total Assets. It measures operating efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **X4 Market Value of Equity / Total Liabilities:** X4 is the ratio of Market Value of Equity divided by Total Liabilities. It measures leverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **X5 Sales / Total Assets:** X5 is the ratio of Sales divided by Total Assets. It measures asset turnover.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Financial status:** The Z-Score indicates financial solvency and predicts bankruptcy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Investment decisions:** Investors use the Z-Score to evaluate investment risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lending decisions:** Banks use the Z-Score to make lending decisions by assessing creditworthiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Audits:** Auditors use the Z-Score to evaluate business financial health.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Z-Score is a useful financial metric with many applications for assessing financial health.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Does not consider qualitative factors:** The Altman Z-Score is solely based on financial ratios and does not take into account important qualitative factors like management experience, industry trends, competitive position, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Industry biases:** The original model was developed using data from manufacturing companies, so it may not work as well for companies in other industries like retail, technology, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Backward-looking:** The ratios used in the model rely on historical financial data, so the score may not accurately predict sudden future changes in a company's performance or financial distress.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Private companies:** The model was designed for public companies with available financial data, so it has limitations when applied to private companies with limited financial disclosures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notable Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lehman Brothers was a global financial services firm founded in 1850 that went bankrupt during the financial crisis of 2008. Lehman had relied heavily on mortgagebacked securities and suffered losses as the subprime mortgage market collapsed in 2007-2008. Its failure was a seminal event in the global financial crisis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Altman Z-Score has proven useful for predicting bankruptcy risk, but it is not perfect. The model was developed decades ago and may not fully account for changes in accounting standards and business practices over time. Additionally, the Z-Score is based on financial ratios that can be manipulated by companies. So while a low Z-Score is cause for concern, it should be considered along with other qualitative factors when evaluating bankruptcy likelihood."
